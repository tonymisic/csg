See that "Edit this page" button on the top right? Click it.

Clicking that link will open up the page in GitHub, where you can directly edit the page within the web-based file editor. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and make your changes by pushing your local edits. For editing existing pages, the former approach is fine, for adding new pages, and making significant changes to the site content and styling the latter would be better. :)
