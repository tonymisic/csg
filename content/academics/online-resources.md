## Online Learning 

The GitHub repository [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) is a community aggregated collection of lists of online resources for a plethora of different topics related to tech. Topics range from hardware to full-stack development to decentralized systems. It's worth checking out.

## Interview Prep 

### LeetCode

### Kattis

Online repository of programming competition questions. Many programming competitions use Kattis to conduct and mark their contest. Less career oriented than Leetcode and Hackerrank, with a primary focus on [competitive programming](/student-life/student-groups/#cpc-competitive-programming-club).

### Cracking the Coding Interview

The excellent albeit meme of a book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, who has previous software engineering and recruiting experience at Google, Microsoft and Apple. A good read to prepare those who wish to prepare for interviews with the large tech giants.
